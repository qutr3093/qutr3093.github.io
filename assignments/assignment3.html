        Zendaya Maree Stoermer Coleman was born on September 1, 1996, in
        Oakland, California, to teachers Claire Stoermer[6] and Kazembe Ajamu
        Coleman.[7] Her father is African-American, with roots in Arkansas; her
        mother has German and Scottish ancestry.[2][7] Zendaya, whose name
        derives from the Shona name Tendai (meaning "to give thanks"[8]), has
        five older siblings. She attended Fruitvale Elementary School, where her
        mother taught for two decades.[6] At age six, she and two friends from
        the school performed a play there for Black History Month.[9] She grew
        as a performer in part at the nearby California Shakespeare Theater in
        Orinda, California, where her mother worked a summer job as the house
        manager. She helped her seat patrons, sold fundraising tickets, and was
        inspired by the theatrical performances to pursue acting.[10][11] At
        eight, Zendaya joined a hip-hop dance troupe called Future Shock Oakland
        and was a member for three years. She also spent two years dancing hula
        with the Academy of Hawaiian Arts.[12][13][14] Zendaya attended Oakland
        School for the Arts and, while still a student, was cast in several
        roles in area theaters. At the Berkeley Playhouse, she played Little Ti
        Moune in Once on This Island, and in the TheaterWorks' production in
        Palo Alto, she played a character originally written as male, Joe, in
        Caroline, or Change.[15][11] Reviewing the latter, Keith Kreitman of San
        Mateo Daily Journal called the 11-year-old Zendaya's performance "a pure
        delight".[16] She studied at the CalShakes Conservatory program and at
        the American Conservatory Theater.[17][18] Her stage credits include
        performances in several of William Shakespeare's plays. She played Lady
        Anne in Richard III, Celia in As You Like It, and took part in a
        production of Twelfth Night.[19][20] When Zendaya was in seventh grade,
        the family moved to Los Angeles.[7] In 2015, while pursuing an acting
        career, she graduated from Oak Park High School.[21]

        In December 2016, Zendaya appeared as a guest judge in the season finale
        of the 15th season of the reality television series Project Runway.[57]
        She made her feature film debut as Michelle in the superhero film
        Spider-Man: Homecoming, which was released in July 2017.[58] Zendaya
        wore no makeup to her screen test, a decision that was carried through
        in production, and "add[ed] her own embellishments to the role, such as
        carrying around a mug of herbal tea".[59] The film grossed $117 million
        in its first weekend, ranking number one at the box office.[60] John
        DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter praised her as a "scene stealer",[61]
        while David Ehrlich of IndieWire called her the film's "MVP", despite
        her brief screen time.[62] In August 2016, she appeared in the music
        video for the song "Versace on the Floor" by Bruno Mars.[63] In December
        2017, Zendaya co-starred in the original musical film The Greatest
        Showman. She portrayed a trapeze artist who falls in love with Zac
        Efron's character at a time when interracial romance was taboo. Owen
        Gleiberman of Variety praised her chemistry with Efron.[64] The
        Hollywood Reporter praised Zendaya for "[registering] strongest,
        bringing touching sensitivity to her handful of scenes".[65] She
        appeared on three tracks of the film's soundtrack, including "Rewrite
        the Stars".[66] The film met mixed reception but became the
        third-highest grossing live-action musical ever released.[67][68] In
        September 2018, Warner Bros. released the animated film Smallfoot, in
        which Zendaya voiced the yeti Meechee.[69] She also sang two songs for
        the soundtrack. The film received positive reviews.[70] In June 2019,
        Zendaya began starring in the HBO drama series Euphoria, an adaptation
        of the Israeli series of the same name, as Rue, a 17-year-old drug
        addict and the narrator of the series.[71] Ben Travers of IndieWire
        wrote that she "adds heartbreaking levity to moments when her spiraling
        character feels invincible instead of fragile".[72] The Guardian's
        Rebecca Nicholson called her performance "astonishing" and
        "mesmerizing".[73][74] For her performance, she won the Primetime Emmy
        Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, becoming the
        youngest winner of the award.[75] She would also win Performer of the
        Week from TVLine for the week of February 6, 2022, for her performance
        in the second-season episode "Stand Still Like the Hummingbird".[76]
        Also in 2019, she reprised her role as MJ in Spider-Man: Far from
        Home.[77] Critic Christy Lemire called Zendaya's portrayal "darkly
        alluring" and praised her "humorous, deadpan charm".[78] The film was a
        commercial success, becoming the fourth highest-grossing release of the
        year.[79][80] In 2021, Zendaya starred in Malcolm & Marie, which was
        filmed during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The production
        complied with extensive safety protocols and had a lean crew to minimize
        health risks. The film co-stars John David Washington, and was directed
        by Sam Levinson, who also created Euphoria.[81] Zendaya allocated shares
        to the film to everyone involved in its making, as a way of offering a
        financial bonus when the movie was sold.[82] Part of the proceeds was
        shared with Feeding America.[83] The film had a mixed reception but
        Zendaya's performance was positively reviewed.[84] Brian Truitt of USA
        Today described her as "luminous" and "absolute fire", Richard Brody
        called her performance “the movie’s only redeeming quality”, and
        Variety's Peter Debruge praised her for "wear[ing] Marie's fragility on
        the surface, only to reveal the character’s strength through reaction
        shots and silence".[85][86][87]
